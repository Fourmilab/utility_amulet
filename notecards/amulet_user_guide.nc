                                  User Guide

Fourmilab Utility Amulet is a wearable accessory which provides a
variety of services useful to developers and explorers of the Second
Life virtual world.  The amulet has the form of a golden bracelet
which is worn by default on the left hand (you can change the attach
point and position on the body if you wish—it is not “rigged” to the
avatar skeleton).  It accepts commands submitted on local chat channel
77 by the wearer and responds in local chat to the wearer.  Commands
are as follows.

Chat Commands

All chat commands and parameters, except those specifying names from
the inventory, may be abbreviated to as few as two characters and are
insensitive to upper and lower case.

    Animation [ anim_name ]
        Play the named animation (which must be specified exactly as in
        the inventory, including spaces and upper and lower case
        letters) or, if no argument is specified, list animations in
        the inventory.  If the animation is looped, it will be
        automatically cancelled in five seconds, or may be cancelled by
        entering another Animation command with the name of the running
        animation.  You can play an internal (Second Life built-in)
        animation such as “bow” or “backflip” by preceding its name
        with an asterisk.  Note that whether an animation plays through
        a single time or loops continuously is a property of the
        animation itself and cannot be selected when it is played; to
        stop a looping animation, enter a second Animation command with
        its name, or just wait for five seconds for the timer to stop
        it automatically.

    Attachments

    Fix [ animations / controls ]
        When crossing between regions, either by walking, flying, or,
        especially, in a vehicle, you will occasionally lose some or
        all of the navigation keys and be unable to steer or move in
        certain directions.  The command “Fix controls” will release
        and re-acquire the controls in an attempt to correct the
        problem.  This doesn't always work, but in many cases,
        especially after being knocked off a vehicle in a failed region
        crossing or departing a vehicle after a long trip, it does the
        trick.  Similarly, after being kicked off a vehicle in a failed
        region crossing or by a “security orb”, you'll sometimes lose
        your avatar's animation and find yourself sitting when you're
        supposed to be standing.  “Fix animations” attempts to correct
        this.  These are work-arounds to correct problems due to flaws
        in Second Life.  They don't always work, but it's better to
        have some chance of recovering from such calamities than none
        at all.

    Go [ n / ? ]
        The Go command works with the Welcome module which is included
        with the Amulet.  When you're on your own property (land you
        own), the Welcome module monitors arrivals and departures of
        other avatars on the property and announces these events in
        local chat.  To teleport to the location of the most-recently
        arrived avatar, just enter “Go” with no argument.  Entering “Go
        ?” lists all avatars other than yourself currently on the
        properly, with numbers, and “Go n” teleports to the location of
        avatar number n from the list.  This command works only when
        you're on your own property.  If you have recently entered a
        Sensor command (see below), you can teleport to an object it
        detects by entering its number on the Go command; this works
        anywhere you are allowed to teleport.

    Grid
        Print information about the overall status of the Second Life
        Grid (virtual world), like the following:
            Users in-world: 34349
            Exchange rate: 241.4594 L$/USD
        The Linden Dollar (L$) to U.S. dollar (USD) exchange rate is an
        instantaneous market quote and may have changed (usually only
        slightly) if you subsequently buy or sell Linden Dollars.

    Help
        Give this notecard to the requester.  The Geometric Calculator
        has its own User Guide / Help file, which is requested by the
        command “Calc help”.

    Listen [ [ stop ] channel / * ]
        Listen for region messages [sent via llRegionSay()] on the
        specified channel and show them in local chat, identified by
        channel, sender's name and key (UUID), and content.  The
        channel may be any positive or negative integer.  Prefixing the
        channel number with “stop” terminates listening on that
        channel, and "Listen stop *” stops listening on all channels.
        The Listen command is useful when debugging objects that
        communicate with one another via region message channels, as it
        allows you to monitor traffic without modifying the objects
        that send and receive it.  Note that you cannot listen to
        messages sent to a different specific object with
        llRegionSayTo(), as they are only received by the designated
        receiver.

    Override [ state [ = [ anim_name ] ] ]
        Query animation overrides (all animations if no argument is
        given, or just the named state if specified), or set an
        animation override for a state with “= anim_name” or restore it
        to the default with “=” and no animation name.  The animation
        state and animation name from the inventory must be specified
        exactly, including spaces and upper and lower case letters. You
        can override with an internal (Second Life built-in) animation
        such as “walk” or “run” by preceding its name with an asterisk.
        Entering “Override” with no arguments will provide a list of
        all animation states.

    Sensor [ range [ arc ] ]
        Perform a sensor scan for objects within range (default 20
        metres) of the avatar and with a maximum angle in degrees of
        arc (default 180) with respect to the direction the avatar is
        facing (thus the default of 180 degrees performs a full-circle,
        all-azimuth scan).  A numbered list of objects found is shown,
        with the name, distance, and compass bearing to each, for
        example:
            Sensor detected 5 objects:
              1.  Door Assembly  4 m  296°
              2.  Gimbals  14 m  38°
              3.  Fourmilab Rocket  14 m  182°
              4.  Fourmilab Flocking Birds  17 m  43°
              5.  Fourmilab Target  20 m  141°
        You can teleport to any item in the list reported by the Sensor
        command by specifying its number in the “Go” command.  The
        Linden Scripting Language llSensor() facility reports a maximum
        of 16 objects.  If 16 objects are found, a warning is issued
        that additional objects within range may not have been
        reported.  In crowded areas, you may wish to restrict the range
        or angular sweep of a sensor scan to avoid clutter.  For
        example, “Sensor 5 45” will report only objects within 5 metres
        of the avatar within a 90° angle of the direction it is facing.

    Sound [ play / loop / stop sound_clip_name ]
        If entered with no arguments, lists sound clips in the
        inventory. The play and loop commands play or continuously loop
        the named sound_clip_name, which must be specified exactly as
        in the inventory, including spaces and upper and lower case
        letters. “Sound stop” stops the current sound clip or loop.
        Sound clips are always played with the maximum volume of 1.

    Status
        Show internal status of the Amulet's scripts, including script
        memory usage.

    Welcome forget / present / reset / status
        Control the Welcome module which, when on land owned by the
        wearer, tracks arrivals and departures of other avatars on the
        property.  The “forget" command forgets all avatars other than
        the owner currently on the property, and will consider avatars
        present as new arrivals.  The “present” command lists all
        avatars currently present, including the owner, with their
        times of arrival.  The “reset” command restarts the Welcome
        module and re-scans for the presence of avatars on the
        property.  The “status” command shows the internal status of
        the Welcome module and is of interest mainly to developers.

Inventory

The Animation, Override, and Sound commands access objects stored in
the Amulet's inventory.  You can list animations and sounds with the
corresponding commands.  You can add items to the inventory by editing
the Amulet while wearing it, displaying its Contents, and dragging
them from your Inventory to the Contents window.
