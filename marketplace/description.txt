Fourmilab Utility Amulet is a wearable accessory which provides a variety of services useful to developers and explorers of the Second Life virtual world.  The amulet has the form of a golden bracelet worn by default on the left hand (you can change the attach point and position on the body if you wish—it is not “rigged” to the avatar skeleton).  It accepts commands submitted on local chat channel 77 by the wearer and responds in local chat to the wearer.

Chat commands provide access to a variety of queries, information, and services provided by Linden Scripting Language.

    •  Show region information: location, size, permissions, owner, capacity, and performance
    •  Perform sensor scan, report objects in range, and optionally teleport to them

    •  Query and interconvert colours among a variety of colour systems, including CSS named colours

Land Impact and Permissions

Fourmilab Utility Amulet is a wearable accessory for your avatar.  As such, it has no land impact, and you do not need land to attach it from your inventory and use it.  If, for some reason, you should rez it on land rather than wearing it, it has a land impact of 1.

Development Kit

Fourmilab Utility Amulet is delivered including a development kit containing all of the object components, scripts, sound clips, animations, and documents it uses.  All items including scripts, have “full permissions” (copy, modify, and transfer), so that you can use them as the basis for your own development projects and/or share them with other users in Second Life.  The amulet only accepts chat commands from its owner/wearer.
